# Devin Implementation Notes

## Step 1: News Collection and Analysis
### News Sources
- Configured `NEWS_API_KEY` in environment variables for API authentication
- Implemented support for multiple news sources:
  - Coindesk (`api.coindesk.com/v1/news`)
  - Cointelegraph (`api.cointelegraph.com/v1/news`)
  - Decrypt (`api.decrypt.co/v1/news`)
- Each source has its own parsing logic in `_parse_articles()` method
- Added web crawling support for sources without APIs using BeautifulSoup
- Implemented Redis caching for hot data with configurable TTL
- Added concurrency control using asyncio.Semaphore

### Data Management
- **Deduplication**: Implemented URL-based deduplication in `_deduplicate_articles()` method
  - Uses a set to track seen URLs
  - Ensures no duplicate articles are stored
- **Time Filtering**: Added time-range filtering in `_filter_by_age()` method
  - Configurable via `NEWS_MAX_AGE_DAYS` environment variable (default: 7 days)
  - Filters out articles older than the specified threshold

### Database Integration
- Created `NewsArticle` model in database schema
- Fields include:
  - source (news source identifier)
  - title
  - url (unique constraint)
  - content
  - published_at
  - sentiment_score
  - metadata (JSON field for additional data)

## Step 2: Advanced AI Integration
### News Sentiment Analysis
- Created `NewsSentimentAnalyzer` class with dual-model approach:
  - Primary: FinBERT for financial sentiment analysis
  - Fallback: DeepSeek API for complex cases
- Implemented confidence threshold-based model selection
- Added Redis caching for sentiment scores
- Integrated with error handling and validation

### Social Media Analysis
- Implemented Twitter and Reddit API integration
- Added weighted sentiment aggregation based on engagement
- Supports real-time monitoring of crypto discussions
- Includes automatic rate limiting and error handling

### System Monitoring
- Added real-time performance monitoring with Prometheus support
- Implemented system metrics collection (CPU, memory, connections)
- Created component health checks with automatic recovery
- Added performance statistics with response times and error rates
- Configurable through environment variables:
  ```
  USE_PROMETHEUS=true/false
  METRICS_INTERVAL=60
  USE_REDIS=true/false
  REDIS_URL=redis://localhost
  ```

### Module Stubs Implementation
All modules follow a consistent pattern with:
- Proper initialization/cleanup methods
- Error handling
- Logging support
- Type hints

1. **Social Media Analyzer**
   - Twitter and Reddit analysis support
   - Sentiment aggregation
   - Volume tracking

2. **Risk Controller**
   - Trade risk assessment
   - Position size management
   - Stop loss handling

3. **Backtester**
   - Historical data loading
   - Strategy testing
   - Performance metrics

4. **Data Visualizer**
   - Performance charts
   - Trade history visualization
   - Risk dashboards

5. **Exception Handler**
   - Centralized error handling
   - Error logging and tracking
   - Error statistics

6. **Real-time Monitor**
   - System metrics tracking
   - Component health checks
   - Performance statistics

7. **Config Manager**
   - Configuration loading/validation
   - Environment variable management
   - Dynamic config updates

## Environment Variables
Required environment variables:
```
NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEWS_MAX_AGE_DAYS=7
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
DEEPSEEK_API_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1
DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-chat
MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.7
MAX_RETRIES=3
RETRY_DELAY=1
```

## Testing
- Comprehensive test suite for news collector
- Mock responses for API testing
- Error handling verification
- Integration tests for AI analysis

## Future Improvements
1. Implement specific parsing logic for Cointelegraph and Decrypt
2. Add more sophisticated deduplication (content similarity)
3. Enhance error recovery mechanisms
4. Add rate limiting for API calls
5. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
